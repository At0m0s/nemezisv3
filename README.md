# nemezisv3
An updated and cross platform version of @DuIslingr's Nemezisv2.

NemezisV3 uses the keystone and capstone libraries to convert ASM to HEX, and HEX to ASM.  This is mainly just a GUI frontend for the two tools.

It can currently only convert ASM->HEX, I'm working on the reverse.

# Supported architectures
*ARM (little/big endian, thumb)
*AARCH64 (little/big endian, thumb)
*x86 (32, 64)

# Planned
*Everything else :D

# Usage
Feel free to do whatever you like with this code, I just made it because I wanted to be able to convert stuff while on linux.
